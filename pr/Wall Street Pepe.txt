New Meme Coin Wall Street Pepe Price Surges 58% at Launch, $WEPE Next 10x Frog Coin?



Monday 17 February 2025 â€“ New meme coin Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) zoomed to a 58% gain when it launched today at 2pm UTC.

The latest Pepe-themed coin is a first-of-its-kind token taking on the manipulators in cryptoâ€™s whale-infested waters. $WEPE is leveling the game for ordinary investors by building its own insider group trading community, but one that rewards Ordinary Joe token holders with top returns.

Listing at a price of $0.0002168, within the first minutes on the open market $WEPE leapt in price to $0.0003445. Trading on the Ethereum chain, some presale token holders have taken the opportunity to book profits after the surge in market capitalization above $60 million.

If you are a presale buyer you can claim your tokens on the Wall Street Pepe website or in the Best Wallet app.

In price moves similar to the debut of other well-received frog-themed token launches, such as Pepe Unchained, early profit-taking is likely to give way to renewed buying as savvy traders charge into tempting entry points. 

Kicking off trading as the US market got going, Ethereum was trading up 4.5% higher over the past 24 hours, which will bolster ERC20-compatible $WEPE.

Meanwhile, Pepe is up 5.5% at $0.00001028, confirming the enduring strength of the frog brand â€“ another booster for $WEPE launch day. Overall the meme coin category is up 1,42% at $72.2 billion, providing $WEPE with a firm platform to advance.

Although the price briefly dipped below the first presale price of $0.000202, one whale took this as a buying opportunity and jumped in with a massive $365,398 $WEPE buy.

Since then more $300k whales have swum along as the price returned near to the high of the day an hour into launch.

Trading volume rockets past $7m as centralized exchanges eye $WEPE token listing

Wall Street Pepe is to-date the biggest meme coin presale of the year, attaining a raise total in excess of  $73 million.

After hitting the decentralized exchange (DEX) $WEPE is quickly attracting a new audience that is asking if it could be the next top 10 meme coin.

After all, Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) reached a market cap of $548 million â€“ so $WEPE, with its ambitious use case aimed at upending trading to benefit the little guy, thereâ€™s no telling where this narrative could take the latest frog coin on the block.

One price prediction has Wall Street Pepe killing a zero to land a price of $0.001459, which would be a 298% increase on its ending presale price of $0.0003665. Based on its total supply of 200 billion, $WEPE at $0.001459 would equate to a market cap valuation of $291 million. Not bad.

If $WEPE were to jump 700%, it would enter the big time as one of the top 10 meme coins, with a market cap of $578 million.

The much faster run rate of $WEPE compared to Pepe Unchained suggests that Wall Street Pepe has every chance of bettering the performance of $PEPU.

With momentum expected to accelerate, a $100 million market cap could be around the corner, and that will make the centralized exchanges sit up and take notice. 

According to DEXTools, the trading volume has already passed the $7.3 million mark while liquidity is an extremely healthy $2.3 million. Etherscan shows that 26,825 token holders are present.
